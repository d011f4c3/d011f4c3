# Hi, I'm d011f4c3! 👋

🚀 **Aspiring Quantum Security White-Hat**  
🔒 Exploring quantum attacks, post-quantum cryptography, and future-proof defense  
📚 Currently following an accelerated learning roadmap

### 🛠️ Current Focus
- Quantum computing fundamentals (Qiskit, IBM Quantum)
- Quantum algorithms (Shor’s, Grover’s)
- Post-Quantum Cryptography (Kyber, Dilithium, SPHINCS+)
- Attack simulation & hybrid defense frameworks
